# 📍 Location Access Troubleshooting Guide - ENHANCED SOLUTIONS

## 🚫 Why Location Access is Still Blocked

Even after implementing HTTPS and better error handling, location access can still be blocked due to:

### 1. **Browser Security Policies**
- **Problem**: Some browsers have strict security policies that block geolocation
- **Solution**: Use the enhanced alternatives provided in the app

### 2. **Corporate/Network Restrictions**
- **Problem**: Corporate firewalls or network policies block location services
- **Solution**: Use manual coordinate entry or predefined locations

### 3. **Browser Extensions**
- **Problem**: Privacy extensions or ad blockers may block location access
- **Solution**: Temporarily disable extensions or use alternative methods

### 4. **Incognito/Private Browsing**
- **Problem**: Private browsing mode often blocks location access
- **Solution**: Use normal browsing mode or manual entry
